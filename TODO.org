* DONE False positive for footnotes without text

* DONE False positive for lists on right/center aligned text

 This turned out to be more complicated then expected.

  - The parsing is done line by line without context
  - Storing the previous element and looking back is not going to help
    because the lines are not fully parsed yet
  - The list code is insane

This needs a refactoring when the parsing is done in context.

* DONE Category/Categories needs an override

  Not needed, actually. When admin is operating, it should be silent
  as it is.

* DONE Add descriptions to categories
  CLOSED: [2015-05-14 gio 15:31]

Db only, probably.

* TODO covers/decorative text image 

This should leverage the header. Like #coverimage and #teaser. It add
noise, but better then scattering info around. Not liking that so
much, but still this way we keep the crap in the self-contained git.

* TODO Set the author of the commit.

This needs adding a column to the revision table. The author should be
just the username (sanitized) and the site canonical name. Like
anon@amusewiki.org Totally bogus but will give a better overlook when
looking at the history.

* TODO Adding git remotes in the interface.
* DONE Slides (waiting for Text::Amuse::Compile)
  CLOSED: [2015-10-29 gio 13:38]
** TODO show the format in the page, if present
** TODO add the option to enable that in the admin
** TODO add support to the bookbuilder, with selection of fonts and style
* DONE DeployHandler for the DB upgrades
  CLOSED: [2015-10-27 mar 13:07]

This way pulling and restarting should do the trick without manually
applying the sql files.

* TODO Detailed AmuseWiki manual

Explain and document from start to finish the interface (for non-tech
people).

* TODO Support solr as an alternative to xapian?

Replacing it is out of question, because xapian is pretty
straightforward to setup (no user interaction needed) and fast. And
it's not a +100Mb tarball.
