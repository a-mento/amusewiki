Not a bug. PDFs cannot be inlined in the texts, so they should not be
served from /library and /edit, hence, no clash.

Store an hash in the stash, with uris if there it's a multisite.

If present, show the uris for filtering. Same applies for authors as
well.

Check if there are topics with texts for the given language, before
showing the uri.

So there is a need to get in the translations and eventually
descriptions. For this, I guess we need another table, pointing to the
topic id (need an interface probably). Or, a file with translations in
the tree.
