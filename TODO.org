  This implies also cleaning up the served files

* TODO Add descriptions to categories

Db only, probably.

* TODO covers/decorative text image 

This kind of images kind of defeat the purpose of this engine, if we
store the crap in the git. But still, this is a common feature of all
the major blog engines. So maybe it should be stored in the db, and in
a public directory.

Same goes with the teaser, probably.
