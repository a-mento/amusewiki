The recommended way is to install the application from the debian
packages. That way the upgrade is automatically managed by the
package.

If you installed from git and are running the app in the tree:

./init-all.sh stop
git pull
./init-all.sh start

DB upgrades are managed automatically. If some manual operation is
required, it will be listed in the Changes file.

This is the suggested script to do a 0-downtime upgrade. We don't ship
it in the distribution because it looks fragile to run a shell script
which potentially could change itself.

#!/bin/sh

set -e

./script/amusewikifarm_fastcgi.pl -l var/amw.sock -n 3 2>/dev/null >/dev/null &
temp_pid=$!
echo "Started copy of the application with pid $temp_pid. If this script exits prematurely, please kill it yourself"
echo "Waiting for the backup app to come up"
sleep 20
echo "Stopping the app"
./init-all.sh stop
git pull
echo "Starting the app"
./init-all.sh start
echo "Waiting for the new app to come up"
sleep 20
# kill the old
echo "Stopping the backup app $temp_pid"
kill $temp_pid
echo "All done, no errors"
