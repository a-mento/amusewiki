The recommended way is to install the application from the debian
packages. That way the upgrade is automatically managed by the
package.

If you installed from git and are running the app in the tree:

# start a temporary process to serve the requests until we do the upgrade
./script/amusewikifarm_fastcgi.pl -l var/amw.sock -n 3 2>/dev/null >/dev/null &
temp_pid=$!
sleep 10
./init-all.sh stop
git pull
./init-all.sh start
sleep 10
# kill the old
kill $temp_pid

The same procedure is provided in the script upgrade-from-git.sh,
shipped in the root of the distribution.

DB upgrades are managed automatically. If some manual operation is
required, it will be listed in the Changes file.
