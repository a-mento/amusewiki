The recommended way is to install the application from the debian
packages. That way the upgrade is automatically managed by the
package.

If you installed from git and are running the app in the tree:

./init-all stop
git pull
./init-all start

DB upgrades are managed automatically. If some manual operation is
required, it will be listed in the Changes file.
