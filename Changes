1.03 2014-12-07

 - Added 4UP imposition schema to the bookbuilder. The prerequisite of
   PDF::Imposition has been bumped up.
 - Bumped up Text::Amuse to fix a crash in some corner case with weird markup.
 - Added 9pt to the bookbuilder options.
 - The current running version is now shown as an empty file in the app dir.
 - Display the current cover image in the bookbuilder, if any.
 - Added sorting to topics and authors pages.

   logs should not be spammed anymore by dumb messages about session
   deletions because of UA mismatch.

If you use nginx, this upgrade requires a change in the ngnix
configuration. You can run again the script/generate-nginx-conf.pl and
check the differences produced. If you prefer the manual way, add this
stanza in the amusewiki server { } stanza:

    location /private/bbfiles/ {
        internal;
        # the following should be the actual path
        alias /home/amuse/amusewiki/bbfiles/;
    }

Modules to upgrade via CPAN: Text::Amuse and PDF::Imposition. Running
perl Makefile.PL will check if you got the correct versions.
