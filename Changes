FUTURE RELEASE

DB upgrade required. Procedure to upgrade. Stop the server. Run:
./script/upgrade-to-secure-site.pl, apply the sql patch, start the
server again. Refresh the nginx configuration with
./script/generate-nginx-conf.pl, installing the SSL certificates if
needed. Beware that without the certificate installed and the
webserver configured correctly, setting the new SSL option in the site
will lead to a lockout and a redirection loop. If you're stuck, set to
0 the secure_site option in the database.
