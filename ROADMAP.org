   CLOSED: [2014-04-21 lun 18:51]

* Multilingual sites need the following

** TODO add category/*/lang
** TODO add support for uid on display
** TODO add multilanguage support for the same site

* Needed before first beta release


** TODO Test the /special/ namespace, after it was refactored
** TODO remove controller_User and do some deeper tests
** DONE store the pdf attachmentes in a directory by themselves
   CLOSED: [2014-05-26 lun 17:41]

   This also could include storing the special pages inside the git
   itself, so we can carry around the whole site

** DONE git support in Archive::Edit and Archive

   CLOSED: [2014-04-13 dom 13:39]

(and store every change in the git)

** DONE check if the original revision file matches the one we are going to overwrite.
   CLOSED: [2014-04-12 sab 20:30]

Otherwise we have to ask the user to force the operation.

Otherwise we go crazy

   CLOSED: [2014-04-21 lun 16:20]

** DONE updating from remote gits
   CLOSED: [2014-05-23 ven 13:32]

This is related to the bootstrapping with the mass compile.

 - routine to check new, modified and delete files, comparing with the DB
 - routine to run the git pull, and manage remote gits.
 - job for that, we can't bind it so long.

** TODO When a "published" text sets a deletion, notify it

This has been done, but needs to barf more and loudly.

* Backend
** DONE Queue using the db.
   CLOSED: [2014-03-23 dom 10:00]

   Use Text::Amuse::Compile

** DONE bookbuilder Text::Amuse + PDF::Imposition
   CLOSED: [2014-03-23 dom 09:59]

*** DONE Add a form to each text to add the text to the collection
    CLOSED: [2014-03-14 ven 22:27]
*** DONE Store the text list in the session
    CLOSED: [2014-03-14 ven 22:49]
*** DONE Model for the bookbuilder
    CLOSED: [2014-03-15 sab 23:18]

It should do the validation too, to avoid passing garbage or malicious
stuff to the template.

*** DONE Controller for the bookbuilder
    CLOSED: [2014-03-15 sab 23:18]
*** DONE Add the page to manage the options
    CLOSED: [2014-03-15 sab 23:18]

*** DONE Upgrade Text::Amuse::Compile to support merging
    CLOSED: [2014-03-22 sab 10:59]

Fix the wrong language code when compiling the thing.

*** DONE Use IO::Pipe instead of open |- and such
    CLOSED: [2014-03-23 dom 09:59]

*** DONE Job daemon
    CLOSED: [2014-03-18 mar 22:06]

It should run syncronously with a nice -n 19 in an infinite loop with
a sleep of 10 seconds or so. I guess a query every 10 seconds
shouldn't be too hard to manage.

*** DONE job daemon killing
    CLOSED: [2014-05-24 sab 23:53]
    Intercept the signals and wait for the job to finish before
    leaving.

*** DONE Add a limit in megabyte to the target text
    CLOSED: [2014-03-23 dom 09:59]

*** DONE Add a status page where the user can wait for the job, using the queue id.
    CLOSED: [2014-03-18 mar 22:06]
*** When is ready offer the link and stop the queue polling.
*** Delete the file after a couple of hours, we are short on resources.

** DONE The special pages should be kept under 'specials' in the repo
   CLOSED: [2014-05-26 lun 17:40]
** DONE The pdf uploads (attachments) should be kept under 'uploads' in the repo
   CLOSED: [2014-05-26 lun 17:40]
* Needed features
** simple to use
** simple to install
** template management
** page deletion
** category management

* Notes

** Git merging

When pulling from remotes repos, permit only fast-forward. If it
fails, send a mail to the user associated with that repository and
notify the failure.

On post-merge, run make via tiny hook, update xapian and the db.
