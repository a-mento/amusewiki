# AmuseWiki

This is a wiki engine using the Text::Amuse markup (based on and
mostly compatible with Emacs Muse) and a Git backend. It can work as a
read-only site, as a moderated wiki, or as a fully open wiki or even
as a private site. On a single instance you can run as many sites you
want.

The application is written in Perl and uses the AmuseWikiFarm
namespace (for legacy reason, as its predecessor used the AmuseWiki
namespace).

The application has an extensive test suite. However, **do not run
`make test` in the production directory**. If you want to run the
tests, do it in a dedicated checkout, as tests leave a lot of files
behind.

## Documentation

The official documentation can be found on https://amusewiki.org
